Welcome!

Thank you again for considering Hometrack for the next stage of your career. This tech challenge is designed as a chance for you to show us what you can do.

We appreciate that you are taking time out of your schedule to do this, and we thank you and promise to give you feedback on your submission.

If you run out of time, first of all don’t panic. Secondly, just let us know what you would have done next or differently if you’d had more time.

This test is designed for us to get an insight into how you think, work, and what you’re comfortable with. We believe everyone and everything can always improve, so if you have any feedback for us on this challenge, please do share it. :)

The Challenge

Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to create a basic automation suite to validate the functionality of the profanity filter provided by http://www.purgomalum.com/

Ideally you would do this in a framework built using C#, Specflow and RestSharp, but submissions using any language or framework choice will be considered as we'd rather see an excellent solution that suitably demonstrates your skillset.

There is no time limit for this task but we suggest around 2 hours as a guide. Don’t feel you have to create every possible test, showing off your best code will be more appreciated than low standard code with more coverage, you can always tell us what you would have done next in your readme.

Thank you, and good luck!
The Hometrack Quality Team
